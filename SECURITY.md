## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please e-mail to maintainers of this project with a description of the issue,
the steps you took to create the issue, affected versions, and if known, mitigations for the issue.

We should reply within three working days, probably much sooner.

We use GitHub's security advisory feature to track open security issues. You should expect
a close collaboration as we work to resolve the issue you have reported.

You may also reach out to the team via our public [Slack] chat channels;
